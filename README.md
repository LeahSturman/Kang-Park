This is C++ file which computes $q_d^{(2)}(n)$ and $Q_d^{(2)}(n)$ or $Q_d^{(2,-)}(n)$ and their difference. 
It is a very lightly edited version of code provided by Robert Lemke Oliver which was used to compute $q_d^{(1)}(n)$, $Q_d^{(1)}(n)$, 
and their difference.

To use it, input into a command line N (the number of terms you wish to compute), d, and the output file name.
